# investmentSandbox

-  rethink class structure
    - superclass for all positions to require timestep functions?
    - like this, a start and end date calculation should be possible

- but how to implement a strategy?
    - like a balance between stocks every 2 months over 4 years
    - with an added 1000 $ per month

- req.txt so anpassen, dass die linter drin sind
